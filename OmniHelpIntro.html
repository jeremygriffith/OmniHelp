<p class="Heading2C">OmniHelp Introduction</p>
<p>OmniHelp (OH) is a free Open Source LGPL cross-platform, cross-browser tri-pane Help viewer.  It's the only one we know of that is not locked by licensing to a proprietary help-creation tool.  Anyone can implement it with our blessings and support.  The project is hosted on GitHub and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/omnihelp/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.</p>

<p>OH is entirely built from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no applets needed). Its data files for contents, index, search, and related topics are produced  by <b>DITA2Go</b> and <b>Mif2Go</b>, but may also be created by other tools (such as perl scripts) since the file formats are fully documented in its <a  href="http://www.dita2go.com/ohdes/_ohdesign.htm" target="_blank">Design Report online</a> (or <a href="http://dita2go.com/download/ohdes008.zip">download</a> it and read it locally).</p>

<p>OmniHelp is built for <b>speed</b>.  When users need help, they don't want to wait around.  They don't care how pretty the docs are, they care about finding the info they need.  Now.  So we don't sacrifice speed for fashion, or for the new tech that is usually slower than the old tech.  We use the tri-pane that everyone knows, rather than some fancy frameless (means slower) format nobody has seen before.  Loading is very fast, even from the Web, because we only load what is needed for the current request.  Search is instant, because it is pre-indexed; it also provides progressive Boolean operations to widen or narrow the search scope, an exclusive OmniHelp feature, as well as regex search to select from the pre-indexed terms. If you create an index too, which we strongly recommend, you see exactly where each reference will take you <b>before</b> you click it; no flying blind.  And both the index and contents expand and contract so you see just what you are interested in.  <b>Quickly.</b></p>

<p>Nonetheless, you <b>can</b> make OmniHelp as pretty as you want, without recoding any JavaScript at all. All details of appearance are defined in the CSS, which you can edit as you please. We've been surprised ourselves at some of the creative approaches our users have come up with, often inspired by the <a href="http://csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>.</p>

<p>For a real-world example, see our thousand-page <a href="http://mif2go.com/ohug/_ugmif2go.htm" target="_blank">User's Guide</a> in OmniHelp format. You can also <a href="http://mif2go.com/download/UGMif2Go_OH54.zip">download</a> it for local viewing; OH works the same either way. We produced it from Frame source using Mif2Go in just 3 minutes 19 seconds on an older (2.3 GHz, 4 GB) Windows 7 system.</p>

<p>In addition, we have converted the <a href="http://www.dita2go.com/ditaspec/_dita-1.2-specification.htm" target="_blank">DITA 1.2 Specification</a> to OmniHelp.  You can also <a href="http://dita2go.com/download/dita-1.2-specificationoh.zip">download</a> a zip of it (7.8 MB) for local use. That took DITA2Go a good deal longer, 70 minutes, due to the 300,000-plus xrefs it contains, all of which were verified.</p>
