OmniHelp
========

OmniHelp provides tri-pane Web help, using HTML/JS/CSS only (no applets), cross-platform cross-browser, with the same files working for local or server deployment.  OmniHelp is built for speed, and is LGPL.

For a summary of features, see OmniHelpIntro.html.  For a detailed Design Report, including specs for all infrastructure files, download OHDesignReportV008.zip; unzip it in its own directory, and double-click \_ohdesign.htm.  For the JS, CSS, and HTML files themselves, see omnihelp.zip.

Other repositories here that include OmniHelp documentation are for the uDoc markup language at &lt;https://github.com/jeremygriffith/uDoc-Document-Markup-Language&gt;, for the MicroXML parser at &lt;https://github.com/jeremygriffith/mxl-MicroXML-parser&gt;, and for the DITA Test Suite at &lt;https://github.com/jeremygriffith/DITA-Test-Suite&gt;.
